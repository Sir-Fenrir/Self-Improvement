        You judge yourself way more than others do.\n
        \n
        It\'s okay not to know things. You can always ask!\n
        \n
        It\'s okay to forget things. Accept, apologize and move on.\n
        \n
        Accept criticism. It sucks, but it doesn\'t deny all the things that went well! Learn from it.
        Don\'t defend yourself. It\'s okay.\n
        \n
        Be open about your criticisms. Be honest.\n
        \n
        Don\'t colour or embellish the truth. Be honest. You are made by what happened to you and there is nothing to be ashamed about.\n
        \n
        It\'s okay to do things differently than is \'standard\' in society. Just don\'t other people with it.\n
        \n
        To stay true to yourself, you should be willing to say \'no\'. And if you want to be able to say no,
        you should be willing to accept no.\n
        \n
        But being yourself doesn\'t mean you should never put effort into things that don\'t catch your interest.
        If your friends is talking about something important to them, but it\'s not your thing, let them.\n
        Ask them about it.\n
        If you want to be yourself, help others to be themselves too.\n

    <string name="text_thinking_errors">
        - Black &amp; White thinking: Situations are judged in binary instead of in a continuous spectrum.
        Thoughts like these can be recognised by looking for words such as \'always\', \'everyone\', \'never\', \'nowhere\', or \'nothing\'.
        Examples: \"Everyone can see that my cheecks are red.\" or \"I fail at everything I do.\".\n
        \n
        - Labeling future events as disasters: When you are absolutely certain that future events will end in a disaster. Any possible positive outcomes are ignored.\n
        \n
        - Labeling yourself: Judging yourself too quickly, without thinking that the proof for this could very well result to a less negative judgement about oneself.\n
        For example, when you fail at something, immediately labeling yourself as a complete failure.\n
        \n
        - Reading minds: Filling in someone else their thoughts for them (generally not in your favour), without actually knowing what they think.\n
        For example: Your conversation partner yawns, so you immediately think they\'re bored. The other options, them just being tired or them being rude, are ignored.\n
        \n
        - Personalising: Events or behavior of others is seen as a result of your perceived wrongdoings. For example, thinking the manager was grumpy because you made a mistake.\n
        With this, it\'s good to remind yourself that the world does not revolve around you.\n
        \n
        - Thinking you HAVE to do something: Following strict and harsh rules, where failing to adhere to these is seen as terrible.
        For example: \"I can\'t be overweight, because then I\'m unattractive.\" or \"I have to check the front door three times otherwise we\'ll be burgled and it\'ll be my fault.\".\n
        \n
        - Negative thinking: Neutral or even positive events are interpreted as negative anyway.
        For example: A good result is purely seen as being lucky or being invited somewhere and thinking they only invite you out of pity.\n
        \n
        - Selective observation: Mostly having attention for the negatives. Focusing on a negative detail from an event and only thinking about that, thus the whole event is seen as negative.\n
        \n
        - Generalising: Leaping to big conclusions because of one or only a few experiences. Because it happened once, it will always go like this. Because I now â€¦ then it will always be like this.\n
        \n
        - Lack of empathy: Not being able to or wanting to understand why something goes the way it goes.
        Not having an eye for important parts of circumstances and events in someones life which explain human behaviour.\n
